 Current Project Status

  You have a complete Phase 1 implementation of the Sonar platform. Here's what's been built:

  What's Executable:

  1. whale-watcher service - Monitors Solana blockchain for whale transactions
  2. notifier service - Sends alerts when trading signals are detected
  3. sonar CLI - Command-line tool for managing wallets and viewing data

  Project Location:

  The entire project is in the sonar-platform/ directory.

  Steps to Test the Project

  1. First-Time Setup

  cd sonar-platform

  # Install all dependencies
  npm install

  # Copy environment template
  cp .env.example .env

  2. Configure Environment Variables

  Edit .env file with your actual credentials:
  SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
  SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
  HELIUS_API_KEY=your-helius-api-key

  # Optional for notifications
  TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token
  TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your-chat-id
  DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your-webhook-url

  3. Set Up Database

  1. Go to https://supabase.com and create a new project
  2. Once created, go to SQL Editor in Supabase dashboard
  3. Copy the entire contents of scripts/supabase-schema.sql
  4. Paste and run it in the SQL Editor

  4. Build the Project

  # From sonar-platform directory
  npm run build

  5. Make CLI Available

  cd cli
  npm link
  cd ..

  6. Test the System

  Step 1: Add Some Test Wallets

  # Add a whale wallet to track
  sonar wallet add GJRs4QW29MWVFgVFuHEiKBVGv1uG82HnzFNDvvdm5cAW --name "Test Whale 1"

  # List wallets to confirm
  sonar wallet list

  Step 2: Start the Services

  Open 3 terminal windows:

  Terminal 1 - Whale Watcher:
  cd services/whale-watcher
  npm run dev

  Terminal 2 - Notifier:
  cd services/notifier
  npm run dev

  Terminal 3 - Monitor:
  # Check for signals
  sonar signal list

  # Enable paper trading
  sonar portfolio paper-trade

  7. What Happens Next

  When running:
  1. The whale-watcher will monitor the wallets you added for any token trades
  2. When 3+ whales buy the same token within 1 hour, a signal is generated
  3. The notifier will alert you via Telegram/Discord/Console
  4. Paper trades are automatically created to track performance

  Quick Test Commands

  # View configuration
  sonar signal config

  # See all available commands
  sonar --help
  sonar wallet --help
  sonar signal --help
  sonar portfolio --help

  Troubleshooting

  If services won't start:
  - Check your .env file has valid credentials
  - Ensure the database schema was created successfully
  - Look at error messages - they usually indicate missing environment variables

  The system is now ready to monitor real whale wallets on Solana! Add known whale addresses and watch for coordinated buying patterns.
