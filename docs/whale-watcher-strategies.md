# Whale Watcher Implementation Strategies

## Overview

We have three different implementations of the whale watcher service, each with different trade-offs for real-time transaction monitoring.

## 1. WebSocket Streaming (Currently Active) ⚡

**File**: `whale-watcher-stream.ts`

### How it works:
- Uses `logsSubscribe` to monitor transaction logs mentioning tracked wallets
- Filters for swap-related logs
- Fetches full transaction details when a potential swap is detected
- Near real-time detection (< 1 second latency)

### Pros:
- **Real-time**: Detects trades within milliseconds
- **Efficient**: Only processes relevant transactions
- **Scalable**: Can handle many wallets with one connection

### Cons:
- **Complex**: Requires parsing logs to identify swaps
- **WebSocket stability**: Needs reconnection handling
- **Two-step process**: Log notification → fetch transaction details

### Best for:
- **High-frequency trading** where every millisecond counts
- **Competitive memecoin trading** where being first matters
- **Production environments** with good monitoring

## 2. Polling Strategy 📊

**File**: `whale-watcher-polling.ts`

### How it works:
- Polls each wallet every 5 seconds for new transactions
- Uses Helius Enhanced Transactions API
- Processes all transactions since last check

### Pros:
- **Simple and reliable**: No WebSocket connection issues
- **Complete data**: Gets all transaction details immediately
- **Easy to debug**: Straightforward request/response pattern

### Cons:
- **5-second delay**: Too slow for competitive trading
- **API rate limits**: Many requests for many wallets
- **Resource intensive**: Constant polling even when no activity

### Best for:
- **Development/testing** environments
- **Less time-sensitive** monitoring
- **Backup strategy** when WebSockets fail

## 3. Account Subscribe (Original Attempt) ❌

**File**: `whale-watcher.ts`

### Why it doesn't work:
- `accountSubscribe` only notifies on account data changes (balance, owner)
- Doesn't trigger for transactions
- Wrong tool for transaction monitoring

## Recommended Architecture

For production memecoin trading, use a **hybrid approach**:

```typescript
// Primary: WebSocket streaming for real-time detection
const streamer = new WhaleWatcherStream();

// Backup: Polling to catch any missed transactions
const poller = new WhaleWatcherPolling();
poller.setPollInterval(30000); // 30 seconds as backup

// If streaming fails repeatedly, fall back to faster polling
if (streamFailures > 3) {
  poller.setPollInterval(2000); // 2 seconds emergency mode
}
```

## Performance Comparison

| Strategy | Latency | Reliability | API Usage | Complexity |
|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| WebSocket Streaming | < 1 sec | Medium | Low | High |
| Polling (5 sec) | 5-10 sec | High | High | Low |
| Polling (1 sec) | 1-5 sec | High | Very High | Low |
| Hybrid | < 1 sec | Very High | Medium | Medium |

## Configuration Recommendations

### For Your Use Case (Memecoin Trading):
1. **Use WebSocket streaming** as primary strategy
2. **Set polling backup** at 30-60 seconds to catch missed trades
3. **Monitor WebSocket health** and switch to 2-second polling if disconnected
4. **Add alerts** for prolonged disconnections

### Latency Requirements:
- **< 1 second**: Essential for competitive advantage
- **1-2 seconds**: Acceptable for most trades
- **> 5 seconds**: Too slow, others will front-run

## Implementation Tips

1. **Connection Management**:
   ```typescript
   // Aggressive reconnection for trading
   maxReconnectAttempts: 50
   initialReconnectInterval: 500ms
   maxReconnectInterval: 5000ms
   ```

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Track last trade timestamp per wallet
   - Alert if no trades detected for active wallets > 5 minutes
   - Monitor WebSocket connection status

3. **Redundancy**:
   - Run multiple instances with different strategies
   - Use database deduplication to handle overlaps
   - Consider different RPC endpoints as backup

## Conclusion

For memecoin trading where speed is critical, **WebSocket streaming is essential**. The current implementation provides sub-second detection which is necessary to compete with other traders. Polling should only be used as a backup or during development.
